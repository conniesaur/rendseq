# rendseq
rendseq is the python package to facilitate your RendSeq analysis!

To get started - install our package via pip

 - Soon to be publshed as a pip package.  Will be updated when this happens!

 the rendseq package contains several useful modules:

 zscores:

 contains all the functionality you need to convert your raw rendseq reads into zscore transformed reads. 

 peaks:
 
has the functions you need to go from z score transformed data to peaks. 

 file_funcs:

contains all the utility functions shared between files.  Will alow you to open/write new wig files (the file format used for raw data, z score files and peak files!)
