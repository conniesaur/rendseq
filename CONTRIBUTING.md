# Contributing to rendseq

Help us make rendseq better!

***

## Instructions:

If you are planning to make a larger change (eg add a new feature please open an issue/add some comments so we know that you are working on it/we can provide feedback and make sure no one else is working on the same thing!)

Otherwise our workflow follows the general Github Work Flow, ie:
 * Make a new Fork of the rendseq repository
 * Add your changes
 * If needed - please add some new tests to test the change you made
 * Verify that your code doesn't break any pre-existing test cases
 * Make sure your code follows good style conventions.  We use PEP 8 style conventions.  We run flake8, black and pydocstyle on all our files.  If you want to check your code for style compliance, we recommend you install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) in your fork of the repo! :) 
 * Submit a pull request.
